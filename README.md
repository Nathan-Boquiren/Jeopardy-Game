 A JavaScript jeopardy game with random categories. There are 6 different categories with 5 questions each. There is also a final jeopardy questions. The host can have up to 5 players, and can change the players' names. Once the answer is shown and exited out of, the host can update the score of the player that answered it (to account for stealing). The question buttons automatically become disabled once the host has viewed it.
